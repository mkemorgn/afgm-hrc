**Why AFGM?**  
<br>
In America, there is an absence of males in the household. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 18.3
million children, 1 in 4, live without a biological, step, or adoptive father in the home or in their life.
Consequently, there is a father factor in nearly all social ills facing America today. When your son is
matched with a mentor from A Few Good MENtors, Inc. (AFGM) that does not signify all problems
will magically disappear. The benefit of mentorship is to provide a consistent adult presence in a young
person’s life. Mentors offer advice, share life experiences, and help a young person navigate
challenges. The impact on our society can be devasting without a male in the home or in a young man’s
life.

+ Men with absent fathers are more likely to become absent fathers themselves.
+ Boys have fewer behavior problems when a male is in their life.
+ Individuals from father absent homes are 279% more likely to carry guns and deal drugs than peers living with their fathers.

**Our Work**  
<br>
We believe that it is our responsibility as men to support our local community.
We have several activities and events that we sponsor throughout the year.

+ AFGM Virtual 5K Walk/Run – This event takes place from October 1 through October
31 to promote a healthy lifestyle. All proceeds from this event goes to the
management of AFGM and to assist other nonprofit organizations in our area.
+ Healthy snacks for the homeless – AFGM answered a need from Northern Virginia
Family Services to provide healthy bagged snacks for children who are living in
homeless shelters in Virginia.
+ AFGM Food Drive – In December 2020 we launched a food drive to assist local food
banks whose resources have been depleted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
+ AFGM Shoe Drive – Each year in March through April AFGM will host a shoe drive
to support developing countries around the world.
