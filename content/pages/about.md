**President/Founder Michael R. Morgan**  
<br>
AFGM is not only a mentoring organization to young men but we are also focused on helping other people in need in our community. It’s been more than a year when I founded AFGM. It has been an honor to serve as President/Founder of such a great organization. I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight the top initiatives AFGM undertake, the opportunity that lies ahead and a sincere ask.  
<br>
We set out with seven core areas of development that we believe every man should continue to improve on in their life: spirituality, education, Job/career, manners, health, finances, leadership. These core areas of development are the basic foundation of our organization. I always ask my team when we undertake a new initiative how does it impact our core areas of development? If it doesn’t impact our core areas in a positive way, then we will not participate in it.  
<br>
Any nonprofit organization is as good as it’s volunteers and the people that are a part of it. We would not be in a position to build this organization without the contribution and support of all the mentors, dedicated board members and volunteers. We have an incredible pool of donors who have donated funds and time to our events as well.  
<br>
We must continue to challenge ourselves to deliver meaningful value to our mentees on a local level. As we enter the second year since the founding of our organization, I strongly believe we have a solid foundation, and a community of individuals that are engaged and ready to move us forward.  
<br>
Finally, a quick personal reflection and an ask: I questioned myself whether I would be able to do justice to the role when we got started in 2019. I am convinced today after all the progress we made, with the help of numerous passionate leaders in this organization, that for us to truly succeed, we, as leaders, must never stop praying and giving our time and energy. No matter where we are in our journey. AFGM stands to greatly benefit from the experience, credibility and relationships of the community of volunteers, government leaders, entrepreneurs and business leaders like yourself, especially at this time. I sincerely hope you will consider getting involved in our organization. Feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or comments.
